Relative Imports

relative to sys.path which gets set when executing this module as a script
i.e. python3.9 main.py adds qabot/ to sys.path and all relative imports
using dot notation are relative to this.


this is why import utils from a subpackage works although the subpackage is
located in the parent dir of the subpackage (i.e. ../utils/)

TLDR:
Use relative imports (dot import notation) for imports relative to sys.path. The currently executed module
gets added to sys.path.
